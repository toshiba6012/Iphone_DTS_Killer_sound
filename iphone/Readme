To install empty contents of home folder to home directory. Then install Termius app from Istore and issue these commands:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/dTS
export LD_PRELOAD_LIBRARY=~/dTS/libdcaenc.tbd
reboot

Once your device has rebooted you have completed installation. Digital Theater Sound only works with auxillary cable and some streaming apps for full support use Poweramp.
