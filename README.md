# Iphone_DTS_Killer_sound
Digital Theater Sound for music files. This software is good for Iphnoe 10 and up. This library isn't supported by all streaming apps I'm pretty sure Spotify is supported. For full support use your own music files and play them with Poweramp. Now I have to inform you that this is lossless audio quality and cannot be streamed to Chromecast or Bluetooth. You can only have lossless audio quality with auxiliary cable and it is necessary for DTS. Enjoy.
